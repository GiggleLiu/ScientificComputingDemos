## Get started
Please make sure you have Julia installed on your local machine. If not, please download and install it with [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/GiggleLiu/ScientificComputingDemos.git
   ```
2. Initialize the environment first by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   $ make init-PhysicsSimulation
   ```
3. Run the demos by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   $ make test-PhysicsSimulation
   $ make example-PhysicsSimulation
   ```
   `make-test-%` is used to run the tests in the `PhysicsSimulation` directory. `make-example-%` is used to run the examples in the `PhysicsSimulation` directory. The `PhysicsSimulation` is the name of the directory where the demos are located. You can replace it with the name of the directory where the demos are located.
